// Question 1: Use map() to create a new array containing objects with just the name and department of each employee

// Question 2: Use filter() and map() together to get an array of names of all employees in the Engineering department        who earn more than 80000

// Question 3: Use reduce() to create an object that shows the total salary expense for each department



Missing Number

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the missing number.
Example: nums = [3, 0, 1] â†’ Return 2 (numbers should be 0,1,2,3, but 2 is missing)
Try to do this with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
