OOP Interview questions

1. What is OOP Is It a language or technology or technique?
Ans. -> its is technique;

2. Why OOP concepts?
Ans. -> OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming System. It's a programming paradigm that use to giving style of programing

Ans. -> 

4. What are the problems with structure programming language?

5. What is the difference between Object-based & Object-oriented programming?
Ans. -> Object-based -Object based languages supports the usage of object and encapsulation. They does not support inheritance or, polymorphism or, both. Object based languages does not supports built-in objects. Javascript, VB are the examples of object bases languages. 
Object Oriented - Object Oriented Languages supports all the features of Oops including inheritance and polymorphism. They support built-in objects. C#, Java, VB. Net are the examples of object oriented languages.

Ans -> An object is called an instance of a class because it represents a specific state of the class

11. What are the object characteristics?
Ans. -> In programming, objects have three basic characteristics: identity, state, and behavior:
Identity: Each object has a unique identifier that distinguishes it from other objects.
State: An object's properties, such as the values of its variables, which can be changed, added, or deleted.

Q3. What is the di􀃡erence between Encapsulation and Abstraction?
Ans. 1.Abstraction solves the problem at design level while encapsulation solves the problem at implementation level
2.Abstraction is used for hiding the unwanted data and giving relevant data. while Encapsulation means hiding the code and data into a single unit to
protect the data from outside world.
3. Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it while Encapsulation means hiding the internal details or mechanics of
how an object does something.
4.For example: Outer Look of a Television, like it has a display screen and channel buttons to change channel it explains Abstraction but Inner
Implementation detail of a Television how CRT and Display Screen are connect with each other using di􀃡erent circuits , it explains Encapsulation.

Q19. Four main principles of OOPS Concepts?
Ans.
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Data Encapsulation
Abstraction

Q24. Explain super keyword in Java?
Ans.super keyword references to the parent class. There are several uses of super keyword:
It can be used to call the superclass(Parent class) constructor.
It can be used to access a method of the superclass that has been hidden by subclass (Calling parent class version, In case of method
overriding).
To call the constructor of parent class.
